## What is MATLAB?

**MATLAB** is a high-performance language and interactive environment used by millions of engineers and scientists worldwide for technical computing, data analysis, algorithm development, and visualization. It integrates computation, programming, and visualization in an easy-to-use environment where problems and solutions are expressed in familiar mathematical notation.

Unlike traditional programming languages, MATLAB allows you to express matrix and array mathematics directly, making it ideal for linear algebra, signal processing, control systems, statistics, and machine learning. Its extensive library of prebuilt toolboxes lets you apply specialized functions for tasks like image processing, financial modeling, and computational biology.

MATLAB supports the entire process of algorithm development‚Äîfrom idea to implementation‚Äîwith powerful debugging tools, live scripting, and app-building capabilities. Whether you're a student, researcher, or professional, MATLAB helps you work faster and more efficiently.
